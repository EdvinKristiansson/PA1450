## Online Weather

`Online Weather` is a program developed to provide an overview of several weather conditions in a given location. By selecting attributes of interest, the user can view and interact with the data through generated graphs. The user can also choose to view the data for attributes of interest over a specific time interval. Either by selecting both start date and end date for the interval or by choosing a specific year, month, day or hour to view in the graph. In this version of the program Online Weather the developers focused on the objectives listed above, but of course the program got potential for further development.  

### Instructions 

In this version of Online Weather the developers focused on the objectives listed above. The user should be able to choose attributes of interest to view through a generated graph, choose a time intervall, view graph or end the program. These objectives will be displayed in a `start meny` when the user starts the program. After the user have picked one of the four alternatives the chosen alternative will be shown and the start meny will be available again. The user can then pick another alternative or quit the program. Once the user wants to quit the program the last alternative of the four will be picked and the program will then end.
